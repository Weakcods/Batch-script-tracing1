#  Trace the execution of a batch script based on the assigned values of a variable and provide a detailed explanation of the resulting output.


## test1.bat Analysis

The script calculates x = (100 % Y)+(Y / 3) where:
- % is modulo (remainder)
- / is integer division

Output depends on x value:
- If x < 2: Outputs "Hello!"
- If x > 2: Outputs "Good Morning!"
- If x = 2: Outputs "God Bless!"

Additional outputs for specific Y values:
- Y = 5: "Y is 5"
- Y = 9: "Y is 9"
- Y = 1: "Y is 1"
- Y = 2: "Y is 2"
- Y = 10: "Y is 10"

Example calculations:
1. Y = 5
   - x = (100 % 5) + (5 / 3)
   - x = 0 + 1 = 1
   - Output: "Hello!" and "Y is 5"

2. Y = 9
   - x = (100 % 9) + (9 / 3)
   - x = 1 + 3 = 4
   - Output: "Good Morning!" and "Y is 9"

3. Y = 1
   - x = (100 % 1) + (1 / 3)
   - x = 0 + 0 = 0
   - Output: "Hello!" and "Y is 1"

Note: Script includes input validation and prevents division by zero.

# test2.bat Batch Script Output 

For each value of a:

- If a == 3    → Output: 1234  (because 1 ≤ 3 ≤ 5)
- If a == 8    → Output: 5678  (because 6 ≤ 8 ≤ 10)
- If a == -5   → No output     (because -5 < 1)
- If a == 24   → Output: 9999  (because 24 > 10)
- If a == -10  → No output     (because -10 < 1)
- If a == 9    → Output: 5678  (because 6 ≤ 9 ≤ 10)
- If a == 100  → Output: 9999  (because 100 > 10)
